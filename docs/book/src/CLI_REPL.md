# Command Line Interface - Interactive

The interactive mode of the command line interface supports:

* Sub-Commands are suggested
* Auto-Completion
* History
* Reverse Search

## Usage

In order to start an interactive session, use the subcommand client (without any further subcommands):

```shell
$ reactive-graph client
```

You can also start an interactive session to a remote server by specifying the hostname and/or port:

```shell
$ reactive-graph client --hostname=<hostname> --port=<port>
```
