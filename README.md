### About Inexor Reactive Graph Flow

The Inexor Reactive Graph Flow (RGF) manages reactive flows based on a graph database. The main interface is GraphQL.

* Semantic: Graph database with entities and relationships as first class citizens
* Reactive: entities and relationships are/can be reactive: If the input has been altered the entity processes its new state
* Interoperable: Use GraphQL for queries and mutations
* Extendable: Built in type system: components, entity types and relation types
* Memory efficient: Rust
* Fast: Rust
* Secure: Rust
